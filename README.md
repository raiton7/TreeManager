# TreeManager
An ASP.NET MVC application to manage tree-style data connected to database (remember to change connection string in Web.config). 
Things to do:
- Drag and Drop function is not saving changes to database (so moving node to another parent is only possible by changing it's parent using standard Edit form)
- No stored procedures in database
